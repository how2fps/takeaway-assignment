Assumptions:
Only one page interface needed for checking users and redemption.
Users can make mistake so a delete button is necessary.
Users don't need to know when the staff pass was created.
Amount of teams are not in large numbers, which means pagination is not required as of scale.

Able to utilise front-end libraries.

How to run:
FRONTEND: npm start
BACKEND: npm run dev

ports used: 3000 (backend), 3001 (frontend)

Possible improvements:
Pagination
More consistent user interface design
Possibly serving everything on the server side instead of splitting into front-end and back-end (More comfortable with react)

P.S: kind of rushed through this, had only one and a half day free after my mid-terms and have not touched coding in awhile.
